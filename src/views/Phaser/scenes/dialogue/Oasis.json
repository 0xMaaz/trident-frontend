        "Terra-Kough and I go way back. His grit was sharp, but his mind was sharper.",

        "The monks leave the Harbor, knowing nothing of the destination. All paths lead here, this is the core of balance.",

        "I’ve not been to Atlantis in at least a century. From the looks of you, they’re doing quite well over there.",

        "We thought they were pearls at first. The Council of Monks told me I was chosen to crack the first one. So be it.",

        "The Gaians planted the World Seeds, so the forging of the globe would never end.",

        "The only thing set in stone is what was etched by the Gaians. The rest is up to you jolly traveler."
